# LLM Playground

This repository aims to quickly test some AI models using Collab.

## How to use it

On [`play.ipynb`](./play.ipynb) click on "Open in Collab",
modify as you need and have fun!

### Prompts

You may have noticed the file [`prompts/`](https://github.com/RickBarretto/llm-playground/tree/main/prompts),
this folder includes the output given by each model depending on the questions I do.

Feel free to open any of them to see how each model responds to the same prompt.
