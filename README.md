# LLM Playground

This repository aims to quickly test some AI models using Collab.

## How to use it

If you want to play with the Language Models,
open [`playgrounds/`](https://github.com/RickBarretto/llm-playground/tree/main/playgrounds).

You will find Markdown and Jupyter Notebooks. 
Inside them, you'll find "Open in Collab" or "Chat Playground" links,
so you can quickly open and play with them.

### Prompts

You may have noticed the file [`prompts/`](https://github.com/RickBarretto/llm-playground/tree/main/prompts),
this folder includes the output given by each model depending on the questions I do.

Feel free to open any of them to see how each model responds to the same prompt.
